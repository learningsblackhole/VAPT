**challenges with real devices**

why rooted device ? to get better control over device root perms 
rooting may not be avaialbe for all devices ; check if it can be done 

check if bootloader can be unlocked ?
if yes then we can unloack bootloader and flash a custom ROM

if not then we need to use some root exploit to root the device

**Lab Setup using -x86 emulator **
_______________________________________

install android studio and check if adb is now available in your system path 
spin up x86 emulator - which one ? 
frida server for x86 architecture -- push it on the emulator 
frida client on your android device 
to avoid installing both seperately we can install a tool called objection :why ?: objection is built on top of frida it will take care of frida behind the scenes 

avd manager --> create new virtual device --> phone pixel xl --> oreo --> api 27
