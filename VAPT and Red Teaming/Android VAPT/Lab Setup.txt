Laptop with Android Studio 
A rooted Android phone or an Android Emulator 

setting up lab for non rooted device also here

why rooted device ? to get better control over device root perms 
rooting may not be avaialbe for all devices ; check if it can be done 

check if bootloader can be unlocked ?
if yes then we can unloack bootloader and flash a custom ROM

if not then we need to use some root exploit to root the device

**Lab Setup using -x86 emulator **
_______________________________________

install android studio and check if adb is now available in your system path 
spin up x86 emulator  
frida server for x86 architecture -- push it on the emulator 
frida client on your android device 
to avoid installing both seperately we can install a tool called objection :why ?: objection is built on top of frida it will take care of frida behind the scenes 

android studio --> click icon for avd manager --> create new virtual device --> phone pixel xl --> oreo --> api 27
go to frida github releases and download the frida server for android x86.xz
unzip the frida server and push it to android device using adb
adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
adb push src dst 
/data/local/tmp/ is known writable path just like /tmp in linux 

adb shell 
	to connect to remote machine 
and check if the file is pushed or not 
chmod +x frida-server 
./frida-server
run your frida server on target android device 
now we need frida client to interact with this frida server but we will not download it directly instead we will download objection that is built upon frida 


install objection now 

google objection github page 
objection is available in pip 
pip install objection 

add frida and objection to system paths to make them avlble anywhere 
confirm with 
which frida
which objection



frida server is already running 

using frida client now 
frida-ps -Uai

to check if I can hook into target application
